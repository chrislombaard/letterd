# Letterd - Newsletter Platform

A full-stack newsletter application built with Next.js, Prisma, and TypeScript. Create, schedule, and send newsletters to subscribers with automated email delivery.

## Quick Start for Reviewers

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/chrislombaard/letterd.git
cd letterd
npm install

# 2. Set up database (requires PostgreSQL)
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local: set DATABASE_URL and optionally ADMIN_PASS
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma db seed

# 3. Start the app
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000

# 4. Test it out
npm test  # Run 34 tests
node scripts/reviewer-guide.js  # Health check
```

**No email service required** - the app works with mock emails for testing.

## Features

- **Newsletter Creation**: Rich HTML newsletters with immediate or scheduled publishing
- **Subscriber Management**: Email subscription with unsubscribe functionality
- **Email Delivery**: Automated background processing with delivery tracking
- **Admin Dashboard**: Protected interface for system monitoring
- **Real-time UI**: Live updates when newsletters are published
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 34 tests covering frontend, API, and integration workflows

## Technology Stack Choices

**Next.js 15 with App Router**: Needed full-stack capabilities in one framework. App Router provides modern React patterns with built-in API routes, eliminating the need for a separate backend service.

**Prisma + PostgreSQL**: Required type-safe database access with good developer experience. PostgreSQL handles the relational structure (posts, subscribers, deliveries) better than NoSQL. Never used Prisma before - turned out to be much easier than traditional ORMs.

**Custom Background Processing**: Built simple cron-based task queue instead of Redis/external services to keep infrastructure minimal while maintaining full control over email delivery logic.

**Resend for Email**: Developer-friendly API with good deliverability rates. Supports sandbox mode for free testing without domain verification.

**React Testing Library + Jest**: Comprehensive testing strategy covering user interactions, API endpoints, and end-to-end workflows. 34 tests provide confidence in core functionality.

## Key Trade-offs Made

**Custom Task Queue vs External Service**: Built in-process task handling instead of using Redis/SQS. This limits horizontal scaling but reduces infrastructure complexity and keeps costs low for smaller deployments.

**Single Database vs Microservices**: Used one PostgreSQL database for all data instead of separate services for posts/subscribers/delivery. Simpler to deploy and debug, but creates coupling between domains.

**Mock Email Service**: Development mode uses console logging instead of requiring email configuration. Great for testing but means reviewers can't see real email delivery without setup.

**Basic Auth vs OAuth**: Used simple username/password for admin routes instead of full OAuth implementation. Faster to build but less secure for production use.

**Cron-based Scheduling**: External cron job triggers scheduled email processing instead of internal scheduling. Requires external setup but works reliably across deployment platforms.

These trade-offs prioritize simplicity and fast development while maintaining core functionality. Acceptable for MVP and small-scale deployments.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database
- Resend account (optional)

### Environment Configuration

```env
# Required
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/letterd"
ADMIN_USER="admin"
ADMIN_PASS="your_secure_password"
CRON_SECRET="generated_secret_key"

# Optional (uses mock service if not set)
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_api_key"
FROM_EMAIL="onboarding@resend.dev"  # Free sandbox mode
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### Database Setup

```

### Quick Setup Script

```bash
node scripts/setup-email.js  
```

## API Endpoints

### Core Operations

```bash
# Create newsletter (immediate)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test","subject":"Test","bodyHtml":"<p>Test</p>","publishNow":true}'

# Create newsletter (scheduled)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Future","subject":"Later","bodyHtml":"<p>Later</p>","scheduledAt":"2025-12-25T10:00:00Z"}'

# Add subscriber
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/subscribers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com"}'

# Trigger cron processing
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/cron/tick?secret=YOUR_CRON_SECRET"

curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

## Testing

```bash
npm test
npm test -- --watch
npm run coverage
```

Test coverage includes:

- Frontend components and user interactions
- API route validation and error handling
- End-to-end newsletter publishing workflows
- Background task processing and email delivery

**Status: 34/34 tests passing** (API route tests work via integration tests due to Jest/Next.js compatibility issues)

## Production Deployment

### Environment Setup
```env
# Required for production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://prod_user:password@prod_host:5432/letterd
DIRECT_URL=postgresql://prod_user:password@prod_host:5432/letterd
RESEND_API_KEY=re_production_key
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
ADMIN_USER=admin
ADMIN_PASS=secure_production_password
CRON_SECRET=cryptographically_secure_random_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
````

### Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Build application
npm run build
npm start

# 2. Database migration
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma db seed

# 3. Set up cron job to hit /api/cron/tick endpoint
# Example with GitHub Actions, cron service, or server cron
```

### Production Considerations

- **Database**: Use managed PostgreSQL (Supabase, Neon, or AWS RDS)
- **Email Service**: Verify domain in Resend for production deliverability
- **Cron Jobs**: External service to trigger `/api/cron/tick?secret=SECRET`
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for failed deliveries and stuck tasks
- **Security**: Use strong passwords, secure secrets, and HTTPS only

### Deployment Platforms

- **Vercel**: Deploy directly from GitHub with environment variables
- **Railway/Render**: Full-stack deployment with PostgreSQL add-on
- **Docker**: Use included Dockerfile for container deployment

## Future Improvements

Given more time, these improvements would be prioritized:

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)

- Worker locking to prevent race conditions in email delivery
- Circuit breaker pattern for email service reliability
- Enhanced monitoring dashboard with delivery metrics
- Dead letter queue for failed email investigation

### Medium-term (1-2 months)

- Horizontal scaling support with stateless workers
- Advanced retry strategies with exponential backoff
- Email template editor with drag-and-drop interface
- Webhook support for delivery notifications

### Long-term (3+ months)

- Multi-tenant support for multiple newsletters
- Advanced analytics and subscriber segmentation
- API rate limiting and usage monitoring

**When to add them**: Immediate needs first (worker locking), then operational improvements as user base grows. UI enhancements can wait until core reliability is proven.

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev              # Development server
npm run build            # Production build
npm test                 # Test suite
npx prisma studio        # Database UI
node scripts/setup-email.js  # Interactive setup
```

## Database Schema

Five main tables handle the newsletter system:

- **Post**: Newsletter content and scheduling
- **Subscriber**: Email addresses and subscription status
- **Delivery**: Tracks which emails were sent to whom
- **Task**: Background job queue for email processing
- **CronExecution**: Prevents duplicate cron job execution

## Key Features Explained

### Publishing Modes

The app supports three distinct publishing workflows:

1. **Draft Mode**: Save content without sending

   ```json
   { "title": "...", "subject": "...", "bodyHtml": "..." }
   ```

2. **Immediate Publishing**: Publish and send immediately

   ```json
   { "title": "...", "subject": "...", "bodyHtml": "...", "publishNow": true }
   ```

   - Creates post with `SENT` status
   - Immediately generates delivery records for all active subscribers
   - Creates email tasks for background processing
   - **Updates UI immediately** using SWR cache invalidation

3. **Scheduled Publishing**: Schedule for future delivery
   ```json
   {
     "title": "...",
     "subject": "...",
     "bodyHtml": "...",
     "scheduledAt": "2025-12-25T10:00:00Z"
   }
   ```

   - Creates post with `SCHEDULED` status
   - Processed by cron job at scheduled time

### Real-time UI Updates

When you publish a post immediately:

1. Form submission completes with success notification
2. `refreshPosts()` automatically called via SWR `mutate()`
3. Post list re-fetches from `/api/posts`
4. New post appears in the list instantly

## API Endpoints

### Posts

- `GET /api/posts` - List all published posts
- `POST /api/posts` - Create new post
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Newsletter Title",
    "subject": "Email Subject",
    "bodyHtml": "<h1>Content</h1>",
    "publishNow": true,
    "scheduledAt": "2025-12-25T10:00:00Z"
  }
  ```

### Subscribers

- `POST /api/subscribers` - Add new subscriber
- `GET /api/subscribers` - List subscribers (admin only)

### Background Tasks

- `POST /api/cron/tick?secret=CRON_SECRET` - Process scheduled posts and emails
- `GET /api/cron/health` - Check system health
- `GET /api/tasks` - View background task queue
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create background task

### Utilities

- `POST /api/test-email` - Send test email
- `GET /api/admin/dashboard` - Admin dashboard metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Errors**:

```bash
brew services start postgresql

docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

**Email Not Sending**:

- Check `RESEND_API_KEY` is valid
- Verify `FROM_EMAIL` domain is verified in Resend
- Use `onboarding@resend.dev` for sandbox testing
- Check console logs for mock email output

**Tests Failing**:

- Ensure test database is clean: `npm run test:reset`
- Check environment variables in `.env.test`
- Run tests individually: `npm test -- __tests__/specific.test.tsx`

**Production Build Errors**:

- `'React' must be in scope when using JSX`: Fixed - React is now imported in all JSX files
- Type errors: Run `npm run build` to check TypeScript compilation
- Missing environment variables: Ensure all required env vars are set
